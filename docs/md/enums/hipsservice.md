CDS/P/2MASS6X/H

2MASS6X H
During the final months of 2MASS observatory operations, a campaign of targeted "long exposure" observations was carried out during times when no previously unscanned parts of the sky were available for the main survey. These observations used the same freeze-frame scanning technique employed for the survey, but with READ2-READ1 exposures six times longer than was used for normal survey observations (hence they are referred to as "6x" observations). The 2MASS 6x measurements were intended to probe ~1 magnitude deeper than the main survey in unconfused regions. Approximately 590 deg2 of sky distributed in 30 targeted regions were scanned at least once using the long exposures. Most of this area is concentrated in two large, comprehensive surveys of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, 383 deg2 and 127 deg2, respectively. Twenty-eight additional smaller fields were mapped in the 6x mode from both observatories, covering targets that include the Pleiades open cluster, galactic star formation complexes, M31, nearby galaxy clusters and the Lockman Hole.

*Defined in [hips-service.ts:8](https://github.com/lloydevans/node-hips2fits/blob/d65782e/src/hips-service.ts#L8)*

CDS/P/2MASS/H

The Two Micron All Sky Survey - H band (2MASS H)
2MASS has uniformly scanned the entire sky in three near-infrared bands to detect and characterize point sources brighter than about 1 mJy in each band, with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 10, using a pixel size of 2.0". This has achieved an 80,000-fold improvement in sensitivity relative to earlier surveys. 2MASS used two highly-automated 1.3-m telescopes, one at Mt. Hopkins, AZ, and one at CTIO, Chile. Each telescope was equipped with a three-channel camera, each channel consisting of a 256x256 array of HgCdTe detectors, capable of observing the sky simultaneously at J (1.25 microns), H (1.65 microns), and Ks (2.17 microns). The University of Massachusetts (UMass) was responsible for the overall management of the project, and for developing the infrared cameras and on-site computing systems at both facilities. The Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC) is responsible for all data processing through the Production Pipeline, and construction and distribution of the data products. Funding is provided primarily by NASA and the NSF

CDS/P/2MASS/J

The Two Micron All Sky Survey - J band (2MASS J)
2MASS has uniformly scanned the entire sky in three near-infrared bands to detect and characterize point sources brighter than about 1 mJy in each band, with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 10, using a pixel size of 2.0". This has achieved an 80,000-fold improvement in sensitivity relative to earlier surveys. 2MASS used two highly-automated 1.3-m telescopes, one at Mt. Hopkins, AZ, and one at CTIO, Chile. Each telescope was equipped with a three-channel camera, each channel consisting of a 256x256 array of HgCdTe detectors, capable of observing the sky simultaneously at J (1.25 microns), H (1.65 microns), and Ks (2.17 microns). The University of Massachusetts (UMass) was responsible for the overall management of the project, and for developing the infrared cameras and on-site computing systems at both facilities. The Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC) is responsible for all data processing through the Production Pipeline, and construction and distribution of the data products.

AKARI (Previously known as ASTRO-F or IRIS - InfraRed Imaging Surveyor) is the second space mission for infrared astronomy in Japan. AKARI was developed by the members of JAXA/ISAS and collaborators. IRAS (Infrared Astronomical Satellite, launched in 1983 by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands) carried out the first all-sky survey at infrared wavelengths and made a huge impact on astronomy. The AKARI mission was an ambitious plan to make an all-sky survey with much better sensitivity, spatial resolution and wider wavelength coverage than those of IRAS. All-sky survey obtained by the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) onboard the AKARI satellite, at 65um (Color), 90 um (WIDE-S), 140um (WIDE-L),and 160um (N160).

ATLASGAL is the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy, an observing programme with the LABOCA bolometer array at APEX, located at 5100 m altitude on Chajnantor, Chile. This survey mapped over 400 square degrees at 870 microns in the inner Galaxy, with a uniform sensitivity of a few solar masses at 1 kpc distance. This project is a collaboration between the Max Planck Gesellschaft (MPG: Max Planck Institute fur Radioastronomie, MPIfR Bonn, and Max Planck Institute fur Astronomie, MPIA Heidelberg), the European Southern Observatory (ESO) and the Universidad de Chile. The APEX telescope is ideally located to observe the inner Milky Way. The Large APEX Bolometer Camera (LABOCA) is a 295-element bolometer array observing at 870 um, with a beam size of 19.2 arcsec. Taking advantage of its large field of view (11.4 arcmin) and excellent sensitivity, we started an unbiased survey of the entire Galactic Plane accessible to APEX, with a typical noise level of 50-70 mJy/beam: the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy (ATLASGAL).

The science team of NASA's New Horizons mission has produced this global map of Pluto's largest moon, Charon. The map includes all available resolved images of the surface acquired between July 7-14, 2015, at pixel resolutions ranging from 40 kilometers (24 miles) on the anti-Pluto facing hemisphere (left and right sides of the map), to 400 meters (1,250 feet) per pixel on portions of the Pluto-facing hemisphere -- the side facing the New Horizons spacecraft when it flew past the dwarf planet -- at map center. Many additional images now stored on the spacecraft's digital data recorders are expected to be transmitted "home" in fall 2015 and these will be used to complete the global map. The map is in simple cylindrical projection, with zero longitude (the Pluto-facing direction) in the center. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, designed, built, and operates the New Horizons spacecraft, and manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate. The Southwest Research Institute, based in San Antonio, leads the science team, payload operations and encounter science planning.

The Legacy Survey is producing an inference model catalog of the sky from a set of optical and infrared imaging data, comprising 14,000 degï¿½ of extragalactic sky visible from the northern hemisphere in three optical bands (g,r,z) and four infrared bands. The sky coverage is approximately bounded by -18ï¿½ < ? < +84ï¿½ in celestial coordinates and |b||b| > 18ï¿½ in Galactic coordinates. The DECam Legacy Survey is providing these data in the equatorial region at ? < +30ï¿½ using the Dark Energy Camera on the Blanco Telescope. The color images are based on the g,r,z filters. Data Release 3 (DR3) is the third public data release of images and catalogs for the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS). Images from DECaLS g,r,z-band observations (NOAO survey program 0404; https://www.noao.edu/perl/abstract?2014B-0404) are included from August 2014 through March 2016. DR3 also includes DECam data from a range of non-DECaLS surveys, including observations that were conducted from September 2012 to March 2016. In total, the optical data covers a disjoint footprint with 4300 degï¿½ in g-band, 4600 degï¿½ in r-band and 8100 degï¿½ in z-band, of which 4200 degï¿½ has been observed in all three optical filters.

DSS colored
Color composition generated by CDS. This HiPS survey is based on 2 others HiPS surveys, respectively DSS2-red and DSS2-blue HiPS, both of them directly generated from original scanned plates downloaded from STScI site. The red component has been built from POSS-II F, AAO-SES,SR and SERC-ER plates. The blue component has been build from POSS-II J and SERC-J,EJ. The green component is based on the mean of other components. Three missing plates from red survey (253, 260, 359) has been replaced by pixels from the DSSColor STScI jpeg survey. The 11 missing blue plates (mainly in galactic plane) have not been replaced (only red component).

This global map of Saturn's moon Dione was created using images taken during flybys by NASA's Cassini spacecraft. Images from NASA's Voyager mission fill the gaps in Cassini's coverage. The map is a simple cylindrical (equidistant) projection and has a scale of 153 meters (500 feet) per pixel at the equator. The resolution of the map is 64 pixels per degree. The mean radius of Dione used for projection of this map is 563 kilometers (350 miles). The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.

Diffuse Gamma-ray EGRET maps - 1000-2000MeV
This data presents all-sky maps of diffuse gamma radiation in energy ranges between 100 MeV to 150 MeV, based on data collected by the EGRET instrument on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. EGRET detected gamma rays in the energy range from 30 MeV to over 30 GeV, with an energy resolution of 20-25% over most of that range. The instrument is described in Hughes et al. (1980), Kanbach (1988, 1989), Thompson et. al (1993) and Esposito et al. (1998). The work described here started with standard EGRET all-sky maps (ftp://cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov/compton/data/egret/high_level/combined_data) of photon counts, instrument exposure, and gamma-ray intensity, binned in 0.5 degree pixels, in both Galactic and equatorial coordinates. The energy ranges in MeV are: (narrow ranges) 30-50, 50-70, 70-100, 100-150, 150-300, 300-500, 500-1000, 1000-2000, 2000-4000, 4000-10000; (broader ranges) 30-100, 100-300, 300-1000; (integral ranges) >100, >300, >1000.

Blue Marble: Next Generation offers greater spatial detail of the surface and spans a longer data collection period than the original. The original Blue Marble was a composite of four months of MODIS observations with a spatial resolution (level of detail) of 1 square kilometer per pixel. Blue Marble: Next Generation offers a years worth of monthly composites at a spatial resolution of 500 meters. These monthly images reveal seasonal changes to the land surface: the green-up and dying-back of vegetation in temperate regions such as North America and Europe, dry and wet seasons in the tropics, and advancing and retreating Northern Hemisphere snow cover. From a computer processing standpoint, the major improvement is the development of a new technique for allowing the computer to automatically recognize and remove cloud-contaminated or otherwise bad data?a process that was previously done manually.

This global map base of Europa utilizes the best image quality and moderate resolution coverage supplied by the Galileo SSI (Solid-State Imaging) instrument and Voyager 1 and 2. The image processing was performed at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center using the Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS2) system. The image data was selected on the basis of overall image quality, reasonable input resolution (from 20 km/pixel for gap fill to as high as 200 meters/pixel), and availability of moderate viewing and sun angles for topography. The map projections are based on a sphere having a radius of 1,562.09 kilometers.

Fermi3 300-1000MeV
Launched on June 11, 2008, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope observes the cosmos using the highest-energy form of light. This survey sums all data observed by the Fermi mission up to week 396. This version of the Fermi survey are intensity maps where the summed counts maps are divided by the exposure for each pixel. We anticipate using the HEASARC's Hera capabilities to update this survey on a roughly quarterly basis. Data is broken into 5 energy bands : 30-100 MeV Band 1, 100-300 MeV Band 2, 300-1000 MeV Band 3, 1-3 GeV Band 4 , 3-300 GeV Band 5. The SkyView data are based upon a Cartesian projection of the counts divided by the exposure maps. In the Cartesian projection pixels near the pole have a much smaller area than pixels on the equator, so these pixels have smaller integrated flux. When creating large scale images in other projections users may wish to make sure to compensate for this effect the flux conserving clip-resampling option.

Launched on June 11, 2008, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope observes the cosmos using the highest-energy form of light. This survey sums all data observed by the Fermi mission up to week 396. This version of the Fermi survey are intensity maps where the summed counts maps are divided by the exposure for each pixel. We anticipate using the HEASARC's Hera capabilities to update this survey on a roughly quarterly basis. Data is broken into 5 energy bands : 30-100 MeV Band 1, 100-300 MeV Band 2, 300-1000 MeV Band 3, 1-3 GeV Band 4 , 3-300 GeV Band 5. The SkyView data are based upon a Cartesian projection of the counts divided by the exposure maps. In the Cartesian projection pixels near the pole have a much smaller area than pixels on the equator, so these pixels have smaller integrated flux. When creating large scale images in other projections users may wish to make sure to compensate for this effect the flux conserving clip-resampling option.

GALEX Allsky Imaging Survey (AIS) FUV
From its launch into low-Earth orbit on April 28, 2003 the GALEX NUV camera operated almost continuously. The Project suspended operations of the FUV camera following an electrical overcurrent in May 2009. GALEX data products include a series of all sky surveys and deep sky surveys in the imaging mode, and partial surveys in the near and far UV spectroscopic modes. The principal imaging studies are the Nearby Galaxy Survey (NGS), Deep (DIS), Medium (MIS), and All Sky Imaging Surveys (AIS). The GALEX GR6 direct imaging data release are to be delivered to MAST between April and June 2010. The grism data release will occur shortly thereafter. The most notable changes between GR6 and GR4/5 include changes to the bandmerged source catalog (-mcat.fits). The Project has removed 26 columns which are either redundant or of questionable quality. These include the "BEST" and "ISOCOR" fluxes and magnitudes. The Project has also added 53 columns, mostly FUV measurements using the NUV source position.  Significant updates and improvements have been made to the calibrations used for the GR6 data reductions.

CDS/P/HI

HI
Composite all-sky map of neutral hydrogen column density (N_HI), formed from the Leiden/Dwingeloo HI survey data (Hartmann & Burton 1997) and the composite N_HI map of Dickey and Lockman (1990). The two datasets are not matched in sensitivity or resolution: note that discontinuities exist in the constructed composite map. A pixel mask is provided to indicate which dataset was used for each location on the sky. Hartmann & Burton provide a velocity integrated (-450 km/s < V_lsr < +400 km/s) HI brightness temperature map in Galactic coordinates, sampled every 0.5 degrees. This entire data set was converted to N_HI by multiplying by their factor of 1.8224e18 K km s-1 cm-2 and then interpolated to pixel centers appropriate for HEALPix Nside=512. Since the Leiden/Dwingeloo survey does not have sky coverage for declinations < -30 deg., the lower resolution Dickey & Lockman map was also interpolated to HEALPix and used to fill in the coverage gap. The Dickey & Lockman N_HI map is itself a composite of several surveys which had been merged and averaged onto 1 deg. bins in Galactic coordinates. Their map includes emission between -250 km/s < V_lsr < 250 km/s (excluding the LMC and SMC). The Leiden/Dwingeloo Survey data were obtained from the CDS. The Dickey & Lockman map was obtained from NCSA ADIL. This original HEALPix file is distributed and maintained by LAMBDA.

The Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA) is designed to optimize science from the Hubble Space Telescope by providing online, enhanced Hubble products and advanced browsing capabilities. The HLA is a joint project of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), the Space Telescope European Coordinating Facility (ST-ECF), and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC). Currently we have enhanced image products for ACS, WFPC2, WFC3, and NICMOS, extracted spectra from NICMOS and ACS grism observations.  The enhanced data products were generated from the standard HST pipeline products. The ACS, WFPC2, and WFC3, and NICMOS images have been combin ed using MultiDrizzle, are aligned north up, and, except for WFC3, have been astrometrically corrected when possible (for approximately 80% of the cases).  All HLA-produced images are in units of electrons/second, which for WFPC2 and NICMOS differs from calibration pipeline products; photometric zeropoints must be adjusted to reflect the units used.

Haslam 408Mhz reprocessed
Remazeilles et al. 2014 have re-evaluated and re-processed the rawest Haslam 408 MHz data, available from the Max Planck Institute for Radioastronomy Survey Sampler website, to produce an improved source-subtracted and destriped 408 MHz all-sky map. Large-scale striations associated with correlated low-frequency noise in the scan direction are reduced using a Fourier-based filtering technique. The most important improvement results from the removal of extra-galactic sources. An iterative combination of two techniques - two-dimensional Gaussian fitting and minimum curvature spline surface inpainting - are used to remove the brightest sources (with flux density larger than 2 Jy).Desources destrier map.

CDS/P/INTGAL/35

INTGAL 35
This survey combines 9 years of INTEGRAL IBIS observations from December 2002 through January 2011 into a single Galactic Plane image. A total of 135 megaseconds of exposure is included in the observations used. Survey data is generated for the Galactic plane in the region |b| <= 17.5.

IRIS color
The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) had a tremendous impact on many areas of modern astrophysics. In particular it revealed the ubiquity of infrared cirrus that are a spectacular manifestation of the interstellar medium complexity but also an important foreground for observational cosmology. With the forthcoming Planck satellite there is a need for all-sky complementary data sets with arcminute resolution that can bring informations on specific foreground emissions that contaminate the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. With its ~4' resolution matching perfectly the high-frequency bands of Planck, IRAS is a natural data set to study the variations of dust properties at all scales. But the latest version of the images delivered by the IRAS team (the ISSA plates) suffers from calibration, zero level and striping problems that can preclude its use, especially at 12 and 25 micron. In this paper we present how we proceeded to solve each of these problems and enhance significantly the general quality of the ISSA plates in the four bands (12, 25, 60 and 100 microns). This new generation of IRAS images, called IRIS, benefits from a better zodiacal light subtraction, from a calibration and zero level compatible with DIRBE, and from a better destriping. At 100 micron the IRIS product is also a significant improvement from the Schlegel et al. (1998) maps. IRIS keeps the full ISSA resolution, it includes well calibrated point sources and the diffuse emission calibration at scales smaller than 1 degree was corrected for the variation of the IRAS detector responsivity with scale and brightness. The uncertainty on the IRIS calibration and zero level are dominated by the uncertainty on the DIRBE calibration and on the accuracy of the zodiacal light model.

The 170 micron far-infrared slew data of the ISOPHOT Serendipity Survey (ISOSS) has been assembled to a sky atlas with about 15% sky coverage. The redundant information of the brightnesss at slew crossings has been used to globally rescale and homogenize the slew brightnesses, leading to significantly increased photometric accuracy and reproducibility as well as the homogeneity of the maps. The corrected slew data were remapped with a constant grid size of 22.4arcsec onto 124 maps in galactic coordinates - (Stickel et al., 2007)

This set of global, color mosaics of Saturn's moon Iapetus was produced from images taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft during its first ten years exploring the Saturn system. These are the first global color maps of these moons produced from the Cassini data. The colors shown in these global mosaics are enhanced, or broader, relative to human vision, extending into the ultraviolet and infrared range. Resolution on Iapetus in the maps is 400 meters per pixel. Image selection, radiometric calibration, geographic registration and photometric correction, as well as mosaic selection and assembly were performed by Paul Schenk at the Lunar and Planetary Institute. Original image planning and targeting for Saturn's icy moons were performed by Tilman Denk (Frei Universitat, Berlin) and Paul Helfenstein (Cornell University, Ithaca, New York). The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.

This basemap of Jupiter?s moon Io was produced by combining the best images from both the Voyager 1 and Galileo Missions. Although the subjovian hemisphere of Io was poorly seen by Galileo, superbly detailed Voyager 1 images cover longitudes from 240?W to 40?W and the nearby southern latitudes. A monochrome mosaic of the highest resolution images from both Galileo and Voyager 1 was assembled that includes 29 Voyager 1 images with spatial resolutions sometimes exceeding the 1 km/pixel scale of the final mosaic. Because this mosaic is made up of images taken at various local times of day, care must be taken to note the solar illumination direction when deciding whether topographic features display positive or negative relief. In general, the illumination is from the west over longitudes 40 to 270 W, and from the east over longitudes 270 W to 40 W. Color information was later superimposed from Galileo low phase angle violet, green, and near-infrared (756 nanometer wavelength) images. The Galileo Solid-State Imaging (SSI) camera?s silicon charge-coupled device (CCD) was sensitive to longer wavelengths than the vidicon cameras of Voyager, so that distinctions between red and yellow hues can be more easily discerned. The ?true? colors that would be visible to the eye are similar but much more muted than shown here. Image resolutions range from 1 to 10 km/pixel along the equator, with the poorest coverage centered on longitude 50 W

JPS is an 850-um continuum survey of six fields in the northern inner Galactic Plane in a longitude range of l=7-63, made with the Sub-millimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2). This first data release consists of emission maps of the six JPS regions with an average pixel-to-pixel noise of 7.19 mJy beam^-1, when smoothed over the beam, and a compact-source catalogue containing 7,813 sources. The 95 per cent completeness limits of the catalogue are estimated at 0.04 Jy beam^-1 and 0.3 Jy for the peak and integrated flux densities, respectively. The emission contained in the compact-source catalogue is 42 +- 5 per cent of the total and, apart from the large-scale (greater than 8') emission, there is excellent correspondence with features in the 500-um Herschel maps.

LIGO/Virgo probability maps (0.001 < z < 0.01, 40 to 80 Mpc)
The initial discovery of LIGO on 14 September 2015 was the in-spiral merger and ring-down of the black hole binary at a distance of about 500 Mpc or a redshift of about 0.1. The search for electromagnetic counterparts for the in-spiral of binary black holes is impeded by poor initial source localizations and a lack of a compelling model for the counterpart; therefore, rapid electromagnetic follow-up is required to understand the astrophysical context of these sources. Because astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation are likely to reside in galaxies, it would make sense to search  rst in regions where the LIGO-Virgo probability is large and where the density of galaxies is large as well. Under the Bayesian prior assumption that the probability of a gravitational-wave event from a given region of space is proportional to the density of galaxies within the probed volume, one can calculate an improved localization of the position of the source simply by multiplying the LIGO-Virgo skymap by the density of galaxies in the range of redshifts. We propose using the 2-MASS Photometric Redshift Galaxy Catalogue for this purpose and demonstrate that using it can dramatically reduce the search region for electromagnetic counterparts.

The DEM represents more than 600 million measurements gathered between 1999 and 2001, adjusted for consistency (Neumann and others, 2001, 2003) and converted to planetary radii. These have been converted to elevations above the areoid as determined from a Martian gravity field solution GMM-2B (Lemoine and others, 2001), truncated to degree and order 50, and oriented according to current standards. The average accuracy of each point is originally ~100 meters in horizontal position and ~1 meter in radius (Neumann and others, 2001). However, the total elevation uncertainty is at least ï¿½3 m due to the global error in the areoid (ï¿½1.8 meters according to Lemoine and others [2001]) and regional uncertainties in its shape (G.A.

Using a portable low-cost CCD camera system, 70 fields (each covering 40degï¿½27deg) were imaged over a time span of 22 months from dark-sky locations in South Africa, Texas, and Michigan. The fields were photometrically calibrated against standard catalog stars. Using sky background data from the Pioneer 10 and 11 space probes, gradients resulting from artificial light pollution, airglow, and zodiacal light were eliminated, while the large-scale galactic and extragalactic background resulting from unresolved sources was preserved. The 648 megapixel image is a valuable educational tool, being able to fully utilize the resolution and dynamic range of modern full-dome planetarium projection systems.

The Map Projected Low-Incidence Angle Basemap RDR (LOI) data set consists of a global monochrome map of reflectance at a resolution of 256 pixels per degree (~166 m/p). Each original map tile, defined geographically in the same manner as for BDRs, contains a single band that merges NAC and WAC 750-nm images. This edition, version 1, was released May 13, 2016 to the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory MESSENGER Team website. The original LOI mosaic was released at end of mission, is compiled in part based on images taken as a part of the global low-incidence angle imaging campaign but also includes any NAC or WAC 750-nm images from any campaign that best fit the intended illumination geometry, i.e., low emission angle and incidence angle near 45ï¿½. It is controlled and projected onto a global digital elevation model. It uses a Kasseleinin-Shkuratov photometric model, whose parameters are the same for any given wavelength band across all MESSENGER end-of-mission map data products. This mosaic contains data acquired by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry and Ranging (MESSENGER) Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) instrument.

This global map of Saturn's moon Mimas was created using images taken during Cassini spacecraft flybys. The moon's large, distinguishing crater, Herschel, is seen on the map at left. The map is an equidistant (simple cylindrical) projection and has a scale of 710 feet (216 meters) per pixel at the equator. The mean radius of Mimas used for projection of this map is 123.2 miles (198.2 kilometers). The resolution of the map is 16 pixels per degree. This product is an update to the map released in August 2012 (see PIA14926). The update includes new images for almost half of the moon's surface, with new images from two close flybys, in Nov. 2016 and Feb. 2017. The moon's western hemisphere, south pole and parts of the eastern hemisphere received updates in this version. The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.

This near-global mosaic was generated using data from the SELenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE) ?Kaguya? Terrain Camera (TC) instrument. TC source data originated as map-projected tiles at ~10 m/pixel spatial resolution. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched the Selenological and Engineering Explorer (SELENE, also called ?Kaguya?) spacecraft to the Moon in September 2007. The mission concluded June 10, 2009 when the spacecraft was intentionally crashed onto the lunar surface. Subsequent data collection and mapping efforts resulted in ?the largest lunar exploration project since the Apollo program? (Haruyama, 2008). The high-performance optical Terrain Camera (TC), a 10-meter spatial resolution stereo-camera, was part of the Lunar Imager/Spectrometer (LISM) instrument suite (Kato, 2007), along with the Multi-band Imager and Spectral Profiler.

The WAC global mosaic is comprised of over 15,000 images acquired between November 2009 and February 2011. The WAC maps the whole Moon in one month, however the solar incidence angle at the equator changes about 28? from the beginning to the end of the month. To even out the incidence angle variations, the mosaic is comprised of data collected over three periods (1/20/2010 to 1/28/2010, 5/30/2010 to 6/6/2010, 7/24/2010 to 7/31/2010) (Table 1). Some gores were filled with data taken at other times. The non-polar images were map projected onto the GLD100 (WAC derived 100m/pixel DTM) while polar images were map projected on the LOLA shape model (80? to 90? N/S) and the GLD100 (60? to 80? N/S). Accurate positioning of each WAC image was ensured using ephemeris provided by the LOLA and GRAIL team and an improved camera geometry model (Speyerer, E.J. et al, 2014, Pre-flight and On-orbit Geometric Calibration of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera). To reduce brightness discrepancies across image boundaries, all images were corrected to a common photometric geometry using a Hapke model (Sato, H. et al, 2014, Resolved Hapke parameter maps of the Moon). This mosaic uses only the 643 nm band of the WAC. This HiPS has been created based on 100m resolution WAC Global Morphologic map by

Pan-STARRS is a system for wide-field astronomical imaging developed and operated by the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii. Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) is the first part of Pan-STARRS to be completed and is the basis for Data Release 1 (DR1).  The PS1 survey used a 1.8 meter telescope and its 1.4 Gigapixel camera to image the sky in five broadband  filters (g, r, i, z, y). The PS1 Science Consortium funded the operation of the Pan-STARRS1 telescope, situated at Haleakala Observatories near the summit of Haleakala in Hawaii, for the purposes of astronomical research. The PS1 consortium is made up of astronomers and engineers from 14 institutions from six countries.
Pan-STARRS1 has carried out a set of distinct synoptic imaging sky surveys including the 3? Steradian Survey and the Medium Deep Survey in 5 bands (grizy). The mean 5? point source limiting sensitivities in the stacked 3? Steradian Survey in grizy are (23.3, 23.2, 23.1, 22.3, 21.4) respectively. The upper bound on the systematic uncertainty in the photometric calibration across the sky is 7-12 millimag depending on the bandpass. The systematic uncertainty of the astrometric calibration using the Gaia frame comes from a comparison of the results with Gaia: the standard deviation of the mean and median residuals (?ra, ?dec ) are (2.3, 1.7) milliarcsec, and (3.1, 4.8) milliarcsec respectively.

This detailed, high-quality global mosaic of Pluto was assembled from nearly all of the highest-resolution images obtained by the Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) and the Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC) on New Horizons. The mosaic is the most detailed and comprehensive global view yet of Pluto?s surface using New Horizons data. It includes topography data of the hemisphere visible to New Horizons during the spacecraft?s closest approach. The topography is derived from digital stereo-image mapping tools that measure the parallax ? or the difference in the apparent relative positions ? of features on the surface obtained at different viewing angles during the encounter. Scientists use these parallax displacements of high and low terrain to estimate landform heights.

This set of global, color mosaics of Saturn's moon Tethys was produced from images taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft during its first ten years exploring the Saturn system. These are the first global color maps of these moons produced from the Cassini data. he most obvious feature on the maps is the difference in color and brightness between the two hemispheres. The darker colors on the trailing hemispheres are thought to be due to alteration by magnetospheric particles and radiation striking those surfaces. The lighter-colored leading hemisphere is coated with icy dust from Saturn's E-ring, formed from tiny particles ejected from Enceladus' south pole. These satellites are all being painted by material erupted by neighboring Enceladus. The colors shown in these global mosaics are enhanced, or broader, relative to human vision, extending into the ultraviolet and infrared range. Resolution on Tethys in the maps is 250 meters per pixel. Image selection, radiometric calibration, geographic registration and photometric correction, as well as mosaic selection and assembly were performed by Paul Schenk at the Lunar and Planetary Institute. Original image planning and targeting for Saturn's icy moons were performed by Tilman Denk (Frei Universitat, Berlin) and Paul Helfenstein (Cornell University, Ithaca, New York). The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.

Global map of Titan?s surface showing the coverage derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and High Altitude Synthetic Aperture Radar (HiSAR) images. This mosaic merges Cassini swaths through flyby T104 into a single mosaic. This is a preliminary product. The Cassini Titan Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) Mapper plays a significant role in investigating the surface of Titan. This multi-mode radar instrument operates in the 13.8 GHz Ku-band (or 2.2 cm wavelength) and is designed to probe the optically inaccessible surface of Titan. The four different modes of the instrument Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging, Altimetry, Scatterometry and Radiometry allow surface imaging as well as topographic mapping at spacecraft altitudes between 100,000 km and about 1,000 km, with resolutions for the modes ranging from 100 s of km to a few hundred meters (Elachi et al. 2005) . The observations, particularly when performed in the active modes of SAR, altimetry and scatterometry, are largely unaffected by atmospheric contributions.

This map has a resolution of 1,970 feet (600 meters) per pixel. The colors have been enhanced to bring out contrast but are a close approximation to Triton's natural colors. Voyager's "eyes" saw in colors slightly different from human eyes, and this map was produced using orange, green and blue filter images. The Voyager mission is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in Pasadena, California, for NASA's Science Mission Directorate (SMD) at NASA Headquarters in Washington.

VISTA DR4 ColorJYZ
The public ESO near-IR variability survey (VVV) scanned the Milky Way bulge and an adjacent section of the mid-plane where star formation activity is high. The survey took 1929 hours of observations with the 4-metre VISTA telescope during five years (2010-2014), covering ~10^9 point sources across an area of 520 deg^2, including 33 known globular clusters and ~350 open clusters. The final product is a deep near-IR atlas in five passbands (0.9-2.5 microns) and a catalogue of more than 10^6 variable point sources. Unlike single-epoch surveys that, in most cases, only produce 2-D maps, the VVV variable star survey will enable the construction of a 3-D map of the surveyed region using well-understood distance indicators such as RR Lyrae stars, and Cepheids. The VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey fourth data release (DR4) provides VISTA tile images and source lists in ZYJHKs filters, processed by the Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit (CASU), for a total sky coverage of 560 square degrees.

VLSSr
The VLA Low-Frequency Sky Survey Redux (VLSS) is a 74 MHz continuum survey covering the entire sky north of -30 degrees declination. Using the VLA in BnA and B-configurations, it will map the entire survey region at a resolution of 80" and with an average rms noise of 0.1 Jy/beam. This version include the data from the VLSS redux which increased the coverage region slightly and substantially improved the data reduction. Details are in the Lane et al. (2012) reference. Frequency: 74 MHz, PixelUnits: Janskies/Beam. The VLSSr represents a major improvement to the original VLSS over most of the sky. It includes six previously unpublished fields, and improved dynamic range in 95% of all fields. The clean bias has been halved and is now 0.66 times the local RMS. The largest angular size imaged has been roughly doubled to 36', and the number of cataloged sources is increased by 35% to %93,000.

Venus Magellan Global Mosaic
Global Slope Data Record (GSDR). The surface meter-scale slopes are derived by fitting altimeter echoes from the fan-beam altimetry antenna as a function of time to Hagfors' radar backscatter model templates. The data are then re-sampled at a resolution of about 5x5 kilometers per pixel. Each GSDR image pixel is represented by a 8-bit unsigned integer. Pixels lying outside the domain of the projection are set to NoData (0). In all images, pixels with unknown or unmeasured values are also set to NoData.

CDS/P/Venus/Magellan/Microwave-Emissivity-4641m

Venus Magellan Global Mosaic
Global Emissivity Data Record (GEDR). The emissivity of a surface is defined as the thermal power emitted by that surface divided by the power emitted by a black body of the same size and at the same physical temperature. The polarization direction is horizontal (E-field tangential to surface), and the emissivity is not corrected for emission angle or surface roughness or tilt. This data set includes all Magellan measurements in which the high-gain antenna followed the nominal look-angle profile, in which the observed emission angle varied from 48 degrees off the local vertical at periapsis (ca. 10N latitude) to 15 degrees off vertical at the 90N and 70S. To make the GEDR images, Magellan radiometer data, in the form of readings of antenna noise temperature, are corrected for antenna sidelobe effects and for emission and absorption by the Venus atmosphere. The component reflected from the surface is modeled as a specular reflection with power reflection coefficient equal to (1 - emissivity). The location and planetary radius at the antenna boresight intercept point are derived from GTDR images and the physical surface temperature is calculated using the adiabatic model of Kliore et al., 1985. The data are then filtered to remove low-frequency instrument calibration errors, and re-sampled at a resolution of about 5x5 kilometers per pixel.

IPAC/P/GLIMPSE360

GLIMPSE360
This infrared view of the disk, or plane, of our Milky Way galaxy is assembled from more than 2 million snapshots taken over the past 10 years by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. The data were taken as part of a huge survey project called the Galactic Legacy Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire, or GLIMPSE360. Spitzer spent a total of 172 days taking the individual pictures, and this is the first time they have been stitched together into a single expansive view. The image covers about 3% of our sky, but because it focuses on a band of the sky that includes the plane of our galaxy, it shows more than half of the Milky Way's stars. The blue dots throughout the image are all individual stars, most of which are relatively close to us, while the blue haze towards the galactic center is also made up of starlight, too far away for us to pick out individual stars, but all contributing to the glow. The red structures are clouds of dust and gas that permeate our galaxy, and give birth to new stars. Throughout the image, you can see star birth in action, in brightly-lit regions; look closely and you'll also see bubbles, pillars and other shapes blown out and carved in the dust and gas by starlight and stellar winds. In many areas, dark filaments stand out sharply against the bright background. These dark tendrils are the thickest dust clouds in our galaxy, that not even Spitzer's infrared view can penetrate. The image combines data from multiple surveys: GLIMPSE, GLIMPSEII, GLIMPSE3D, Vela-Carina, GLIMPSE360, Deep GLIMPSE, CYGX, GALCEN, & SMOG. The 12-micron data from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) was substituted for missing 8-micron data in outer galaxy regions mapped during Spitzer's post-cryo mission.

The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is a 5000 square degree grizY survey of the Southern sky aimed at understanding the accelerating expansion rate of the Universe. DES is using four complementary methods to do this: weak gravitational lensing, galaxy cluster counts, baryon acoustic oscillations, and Type Ia supernovae. DES uses the 3 square degree Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a 570 Megapixel CCD imaging camera installed at the prime focus of on the Blanco 4m telescope at the Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory in northern Chile. The survey is being performed over a period of five years (2013-2018), and is recording information from roughly 300 million distant galaxies and 100 million Milky Way stars. The DES-DR1 colored HiPS has been generated from I, R and G HiPS based on Lupton simplified algorithm by CDS.
