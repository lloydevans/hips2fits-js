Simple utility for requesting data from the EDS hips2fits service.

This package provides both ES and CJS module formats.

It is ES5 compatible, however it does not provide any polyfills.

It's a simple setup - Use the `getImage` or `getImageUrl` functions, which take the [HipsOptions](https://github.com/lloydevans/hips2fits-js/blob/master/docs/md/interfaces/hipsoptions.md) object.
